<h3>Introduction</h3>

<h4>A Brief History</h4>
<p>The beginning of the 21'st century was the second Age of Discovery for mankind. This era marked the time of remarkable scientific discoveries, enabling impressive engineering 
achievements and technological advancements that led to extensive interstellar exploration of nearby stars. The late 21'st and early 22'nd centuries emerged as 
a powerful factor in human cultural and scientific development. Many habitable worlds previously unknown to Earth's scientific community were discovered during this period, 
mostly inhabited by non-sentient life forms that could host human habitation. From the perspective of the Earth's population this era marked the departure of 
millions of explorers and pioneers, keen to leave the old world to explore distant and new horizons on unknown worlds.
</p><br>
<p>During the second age of discovery the nearby star systems were explored and colonized and during this period  the wormhole  generators were created to connect the neighbouring stars together. The daisy chain of SWP links provided a vital communication and transport channel with Earth and enabled 
the instantaneous transportation between the stars, separated by vast distances. Within the span of a few thousand years many of the new worlds became 
distant civilizations that rivalled the old world (Earth) in many aspects.  The next significant era was the time of the "thousand worlds". This era, also known as 
the "Pax Terrarum", or "Peace on Earth" lasted approximately 2400 years.  During this time, Earth's interstellar empire prospered to an unprecedented level of political stability, 
and at its height, (c. 4400 ad), was the most extensive . By 4500 AD the empire had grown too vast to be ruled from the central government of Earth.  
</p><br>
<p>The end of the age of the "Pax Terrarum" was the decline of the civilization of mankind. This was the process of decline in which the world government failed to enforce its rule, 
and its vast interstellar  territory was divided into thousands of independent worlds. The government of Earth lost the strengths that had allowed it to exercise effective control; 
the effectiveness and numbers of the military, the health and numbers of Earth's population, the strength of the economy, the competence of the Government, the religious changes 
of the period, and the efficiency of the civil administration were factors to blame in its decline.

<h4>Game Overview</h4>
<p>Age of Discovery II is a multiplayer turn based strategy game, played on a 3 dimensional map modelled on the closest 1000 stars of the Milky Way Galaxy. The map is centered on the Sun (Sol). 
The game begins with the player choosing a starting location, customizing their racial characteristics and allocating resources to build their starting fleets. Multiple vessels can form a fleet.
Fleets are sent out to neighbouring stars to explore, colonize and trade, using Deep Space Moves or using the Interconnected Hyperspace portals. Colonized star systems produce income by harvesting 
resources. Using this income additional fleets can be purchased and sent out to further expand a player's empires boundaries. Eventually the player will run into a star system owned
by another player.</p><br>
</p><br>
<h4>Movement</h4>
<p>There are two types of movement, Deep Space Movement (DSM) and Hyperspace movement (HSM). With DSM a space vessel's conventional engines are used to propell it
through the vast distances of space, This mode of movement is rather slow and will typically travel 0.2 parsecs a turn ( a year in real time). By using the Hyperspace Portals 
a space vessel may travel instantaneously from one star system to the connected star system using this portal. If the player owns the connected star system, the vessels may again use the hyperspace portal
of that star system to hop to the next location in the same game turn. If the player does not own the destination star system contention will take place, a battle or bombardment of a star systems resource planets.
So if the player owns the star systems between the start and destination locations, and those star systems are linked by hyperspace portals it is possible to traverse across the distance in the one game turn.
